Flutter and Dart Application Examples

# Basic Widgets
Details the basics of the main flutter application build process, as well as some basic widgets such as Row, Column, Text, Container, and IconButton.
Rows and Columns contain linear lists of children and can be organized in various ways, using the Alignment calls.
Text objects are used to display strings of content to the user, a foundational element in any project.
Containers are used to layout child objects in a specific format, as well as apply a decoration to the object.
IconButtons are Stateless Widgets that can be used to call other functionality in your application, though they are unable to update after initial load.

# Basic Interactivity
Details the basics of some interactive properties in flutter, such as InkWell, TextField, SnackBar, ListView, and TextButton.
InkWells are press-event listeners nested around widgets to handle their press call appropriately, InkWells are stateful and can be updated on reload.
TextFields take in the user's input and can utilize buttons or event handlers within the textfield to execute specific functions accordingly.
SnackBars are feedback displayed at the bottom of the application window, used to notify the user of a click event when it is otherwise not obvious.
ListViews are similar to Rows and Columns, however they can be scrolled to access information that initially appears off screen.
TextButtons are used similar to IconButtons, when you don't need to change the text within the textbutton, but you still want interactivity.
